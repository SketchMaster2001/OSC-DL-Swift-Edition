# OSC-DL-Swift-Edition
Open Shop Channel Downloader in Swift

## Why make an app for only Apple devices?
I decided to create this firstly because I can never get the python version of OSC-DL to work, and because Qt on macOS looks horrendous.

Using Swift, I was able to recreate OSC-DL and put it on devices it could never before be on, such as iOS, tvOS and watchOS.
